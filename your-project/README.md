## Project Description
Water is a scarce resource. Nowadays, it is difficult to remember as when we turn on the faucet, clean water will flow. But we don’t have to forget that this quest has been one of the greatest humanity’s challenge. Civilizations that harness water, thrived, the ones that failed, felt. As world’s total population continues to increase, global supply of water for each person is in jeopardy. In mid-2017, Cape Town was in a critical situation due to the available water resources. Because of that, a series of restrictions on the global water supply for the citizen known as 'Day Zero' came close to being implemented.

In this project it's shown the study of world's water situation, the evolution of the amount of freshwater consumption and the available resources.
